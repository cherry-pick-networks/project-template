  Principles the agent must follow: conventions, KISS, root cause,
  consistency, rule file format. Apply when editing or adding rules.

Conventions:
  follow standard conventions (formatting, naming, structure).
KISS:
  prefer the simplest option; reduce complexity.
Boy scout rule:
  leave anything you touch cleaner than you found it.
Root cause:
  find it; address causes, not only symptoms.
Consistency:
  be consistent across the project (terms, tone, layout).
Phrasing:
  prefer positive phrasing in docs and specs
  ("Do X" over "Do not do Y").
Rule file format:
  one rule per block; no blank line between rules;
  wrap with indent so continuation is clearly the same rule.
Rule file line wrap:
  break only at punctuation (;, ,) or after a complete phrase;
  never split a noun phrase or parenthetical mid-phrase;
  meaning per line over 80 chars in rule files.
Clear rules (when adding from docs):
  only add to rules what satisfies all three: (1) stateable as
  must/do not/only in one sentence, no prefer/recommended;
  (2) concrete scope (files, symbols, or patterns named);
  (3) violation detectable by static check or simple heuristic;
  otherwise keep in docs or as guidance only.
No speculative implementation:
  do not add modules, endpoints, or infrastructure for a future
  phase or roadmap; add only when the feature is in current scope
  (docs/scope.md).
