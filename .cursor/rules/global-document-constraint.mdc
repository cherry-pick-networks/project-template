  Dependency list lives in project documents (deno.json, docs).
  Do not add deps outside the list; update the list first. Apply when
  changing deno.json or project dependencies.

Dependency addition:
  do not add dependencies arbitrarily; only add if (a) listed in the project
  official dependency list, or (b) the addition meets all mandatory
  stable-library criteria below. Agent must not extend the official list
  without human approval.
Official list:
  the project maintains an official list of allowed dependencies (deno.json
  imports and optionally docs); new entries require updating that list first.
