  Naming and allowed words for rule documents (.mdc segments).
  Prefix = Scope | Layer | Context; Infix = Actor | Action | Entity;
  Suffix = Artifact | Policy | Meta. Apply when naming rule files.
alwaysApply: true

Clean dictionary (one word per concept — overlap resolution):
  middleware: only Suffix (Artifact); never Infix (use interceptor,
  filter).
  policy: only Suffix (Policy); never Infix (use validator, guard).
  cache: only Infix (Entity); never Suffix (use store, storage).
  config: only this spelling; never configuration.
  education: only this spelling; never edu.
  type (TS/classification): use types in Suffix Meta; never type.
  core: forbidden in Context; use shared, base, or domain (layer).
  context (React/API): use provider in Infix Entity; do not use
  context as segment.

Prefix — one axis only: [ Scope | Layer | Context ].
  Rule: prefix must denote system position only; technical tools
  (cache, redis) or artifact form (config, test) must not be prefix.
  Axis "Context" = Bounded Context (what it is for); Layer value
  "domain" = DDD domain layer only.
Scope (blast radius — where impact reaches):
  global, shared, system, module, component.
  Never prefix: app (use system), config, file, code, architecture.
Layer (stack position — where it sits):
  presentation, application, domain, infrastructure.
  Never prefix: api, web as layer (refine into above if needed);
  security, observability, compliance (use Context instead).
Context (bounded context — what it is for):
  business: payment, order, auth, user, catalog, education, student,
  ticket, bucket, item, economy, scout;
  system: security, observability, compliance.
  Never prefix: core (use shared, base, or domain); cache, adapter,
  redis, test (use Infix/Suffix).

Infix — one axis only: [ Actor | Action | Entity ].
  Rule: infix must not duplicate Scope/Layer/Context meaning.
  Forbidden in Infix: middleware (use interceptor, filter), policy
  (use validator, guard).
Actor (architectural role or agent):
  router, service, repository, entity, interceptor, filter, adapter,
  facade, client, agent, worker, guard, validator.
Entity (data or medium kind):
  payload, stream, blob, cache, session, document, json, sql,
  redis, prompt, provider.
Action (lifecycle or operation):
  bootstrap, shutdown, runtime, build, migration, recovery,
  read, write, batch, parse, upload, search, validate.

Suffix — one axis only: [ Artifact | Policy | Meta ].
  Rule: suffix denotes form of the deliverable; context meaning
  belongs in Prefix, not Suffix.
  Forbidden in Suffix: cache (use store, storage), configuration
  (use config).
Artifact (concrete deliverable shape):
  schema, mapping, store, storage, event, endpoint, response,
  middleware, format, exception, config, pipeline, metrics, trace.
Policy (principle, constraint, or policy):
  boundary, constraint, contract, principle, safety, validation,
  compliance, isolation.
Meta (documentation, test, or classification):
  test, documentation, naming, style, log, types, language,
  profile, assessment.

Examples:
  payment-infra-redis-config (Context + Layer + Entity + Artifact);
  security-application-guard-policy (Context + Layer + Actor + Policy);
  global-config (Scope + Artifact).
