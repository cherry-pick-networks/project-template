Implementation plan — directory structure rule

Purpose:
  Apply a single rule to all directory creation except exceptions;
  keep structure as prefix → infix → suffix for discoverability and maintenance.

Scope:
  All directories not in the exception list (root and any depth).
  "Level" means directory tiers only: prefix, infix, suffix.
  Root is not counted as a level; max depth is 3 tiers (prefix / infix / suffix).

Rule content — structure:
  Allowed forms (exactly one of three):
    prefix/
    prefix/infix/
    prefix/infix/suffix/
  Order fixed: prefix then infix then suffix; no fourth tier.

Rule content — naming:
  Each tier name must use only approved values for that axis
  (prefix / infix / suffix); see global-document-naming.
  Lowercase; one hyphen between words; no underscores or spaces.

Exceptions:
  Maintain an explicit exception list; same list for docs and tooling.
  Typical entries: .git, .cursor, node_modules, dist, build, coverage,
  vendor, .cache (confirm per project). Update list and any validator together.

Documentation:
  Place rule text in .cursor/rules (e.g. this file or global-document-format).
  State: scope, "max 3 tiers" (prefix/infix/suffix only; root not counted),
  the three allowed forms, order, no fourth tier, naming reference, exception list.

Validation (optional):
  Script: walk directories from root; skip exception list; assert remaining
  paths match prefix/(infix/)(suffix/) and tier names in allowed sets; exit 1 on failure.
  Run in pre-commit or CI.

Agent / tool behavior:
  When creating directories, use only the three allowed forms for non-excepted paths;
  use only approved axis values per global-document-naming.
  Optionally: recommend a "new directory" helper script.

Execution order:
  (1) Finalize exception list per project.
  (2) Write rule text (this plan reflected; "three tiers" = prefix/infix/suffix only).
  (3) Add or update rule in .cursor/rules.
  (4) Optionally add validation script and wire exceptions.
  (5) Optionally add pre-commit or CI check.
