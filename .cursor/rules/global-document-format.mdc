  .cursor/rules *.mdc and directory structure.
alwaysApply: true

Pattern:
  use [prefix]-[suffix].mdc or [prefix]-[infix]-[suffix].mdc;
  prefix and suffix required; infix optional.
Segment form:
  lowercase; separate words with one hyphen; no underscores;
  suffix singular (except types); descriptive, pronounceable, searchable.
Axis rule:
  each segment uses exactly one axis from its allowed set;
  no axis pollution; one word must not appear in two axes.
New rule files:
  pick one prefix from Scope/Layer/Context; one suffix from
  Artifact/Policy/Meta; add infix from Actor/Action/Entity only when
  the rule applies to a specific focus.

Directory structure (max 3 levels; segment order):
  level 1: folder name from approved prefix (required);
  level 2: folder name from approved infix (optional);
  level 3: folder name from approved suffix (optional).
  Order: prefix / infix / suffix; do not add a fourth level.
