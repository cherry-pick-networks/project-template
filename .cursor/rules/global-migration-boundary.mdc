  Rule file migration (refactor) boundary: when to migrate, plan-first,
  create-then-delete order, naming per global-document-format and
  global-document-naming. Apply when refactoring .cursor/rules *.mdc.

When to migrate (diagnosis):
  rule files that mix axes (e.g. two suffixes in one name or one file)
  or use forbidden prefix/segment must be refactored; plan first, then
  execute; do not rename or split without a migration plan.
Plan before execute:
  write a migration plan: for each current file, list target filename(s)
  with axis (prefix, infix, suffix), content responsibility per new
  file, and which current files will be removed; do not execute
  renames or splits without this mapping.
Execute order:
  create all new rule files with split content first; only after that
  delete the old files; one logical migration (one plan) per commit.
Naming:
  new rule file names must follow global-document-format and
  global-document-naming; use infix from Actor/Action/Entity where it
  clarifies focus (e.g. document, event, agent).
No scope doc change:
  adding or refactoring .cursor/rules does not require docs/scope.md
  change; scope doc is for modules, API routes, infrastructure only.
