Scope document:
  the single source of truth for in-scope modules, API surface, and
  infrastructure is docs/scope.md; update that doc before adding.
Scope-bound implementation:
  do not add new modules, API routes (routers), or infrastructure
  (broker, extra DB, queue, search engine) unless they are listed in
  docs/scope.md; add them to docs/scope.md first, then implement.
