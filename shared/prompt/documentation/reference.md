# Reference and guide (not rules)

**This document is for team or personal reference only.**  
Nothing here is a rule or checklist item. Compliance is not checked.  
Use what fits your environment and habits.

## What belongs here vs in rules

- **Rules** (in `conventions-rules.md`): Things that can be checked (directory structure, naming, commit format, "this repo has X file") or defined in one sentence. See `shared/prompt/store/context.md` Part B.
- **Reference** (this doc): Usage tips, workflow habits, tool preferences, qualitative advice—things that are not checkable or that depend on the person or environment.

---

## Optional tooling and workflows

- **Tips-derived usage**: Scripts and workflows from the implementation plan (e.g. status line, handoff workflow, setup script, dx plugin).  
  → **[tips-usage.md](tips-usage.md)**
- **Tips we reference but do not adopt (yet)**: Short descriptions of optional claude-code-tips; add to tips-usage or context when the team decides.  
  → **[tips-reference.md](tips-reference.md)**

---

## Categories of reference material (examples)

- **Tool usage**: Slash commands, voice, alias, Cmd+A, worktrees, MCP usage—how you prefer to use the editor or CLI.
- **Workflow**: PR review style, how often to handoff, how to break down tasks, when to prototype.
- **Qualitative advice**: "Plan then prototype", "choose the right abstraction level", "simplify when the change set is large"—guidance that stays reference-only and is not enforced.

When in doubt: if you cannot state it as "do X / do not Y" with a concrete, checkable outcome, keep it here or in tips-usage, not in the rules.
