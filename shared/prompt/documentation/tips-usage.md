# Tips-derived usage (Phase 10)

Optional tooling and workflows from implementation-plan Phase 10. Reference only; use if the project adopts them.

**Tips already in context.md**: Decompose (Tip 3 → §6), Git/gh/draft PR/worktree (Tip 4, 16 → §7), New topic → new conversation (Tip 5 → §9), Getting output out (Tip 6 → §10), Aliases/setup (Tip 7 → §5), Write–test cycle (Tip 9 → §6), Cmd+A / paste (Tip 10 → §10), Exponential backoff (Tip 17 → §8), Markdown/Notion (Tip 19, 20 → §10), realpath (Tip 24 → §8), Verify output (Tip 28 → §6), Abstraction level (Tip 32 → §11), TDD (Tip 34 → §6), Plan then prototype (Tip 39 → §6), Simplify (Tip 40 → §11).

## Slash commands (Tip 1)

- When using Claude Code: useful built-ins include `/usage` (rate limits), `/mcp` (MCP servers), `/stats` (usage graph), `/clear` (fresh conversation). See claude-code-tips for full list.

---

## Status line (Tip 0)

- **Script**: `shared/prompt/scripts/context-bar.sh`
- **Use**: Source in shell or run to print directory, git branch, dirty status. Integrate with PS1 or tmux status line if desired.
- **Example**: `source shared/prompt/scripts/context-bar.sh` then use `_context_bar` in prompt.

---

## Handoff workflow (Tip 8)

- **When**: Before switching agent or starting a new session on the same long-running task.
- **Where**: `shared/prompt/documentation/handoff.md` (linked from README).
- **Fields**: Goal, progress, what was tried, what failed, next steps. New sessions attach only this file.
- **Optional**: Use `/handoff` (e.g. dx plugin) if available.

---

## Blocked or private sites (Tip 11)

- For URLs that cannot be fetched directly (e.g. Reddit, paywalled): use a fallback skill (e.g. reddit-fetch in `~/.claude/skills/` or dx plugin) or Gemini CLI. Document the chosen method here or in context.md.

---

## System prompt slim (Tip 15)

- If using a minified CLI or custom system prompt: document the procedure (e.g. patch script, `system-prompt/` directory) locally. Do not add to repo without scope doc update.

---

## Clone / half-clone (Tip 23)

- For long conversations: use a clone or half-clone script/skill to compact context. Optionally suggest `/half-clone` when context exceeds a threshold. Reference in tool docs.

---

## Context review (Tip 30)

- When reviewing context.md: use recent conversations to propose new lines (repeated instructions → candidates for context.md). Optionally use a review skill (e.g. review-claudemd) if available.

---

## Approved commands audit (Tip 33)

- Run **cc-safe** (or equivalent) on a schedule: e.g. `npx cc-safe .` before opening a PR or monthly. See context.md §7.

---

## Containers for long-running risky tasks (Tip 21)

- For long-running or risky work (e.g. research, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`): prefer running in a container so failures are isolated. See context.md §8 for long-running jobs; use a container when the task is both long and permission-heavy.

---

## Interactive PR reviews (Tip 26)

- Use `gh pr view` and `gh pr diff` (context.md §7) for step-by-step or file-by-file review. Ask the agent to run tests where relevant and to summarize findings. Interactive back-and-forth beats one-shot review.

---

## GitHub Actions / DevOps (Tip 29)

- For CI failures: use `gh run view` and logs to find root cause or flakiness (context.md §7). If using Claude with dx plugin, `/dx:gha <GitHub Actions URL>` can automate investigation and suggest fixes.

---

## Background bash and subagents (Tip 36)

- Long-running commands: run in background (e.g. Ctrl+B in Claude Code) and have the agent check later or use exponential backoff (context.md §8). When using subagents, run heavy or parallel analysis in background so the main session stays responsive.

---

## dx plugin (Tip 44)

- If using Claude with dx: install with `claude plugin install dx@ykdojo` (or marketplace). Use for handoff, skills, and other dx-provided commands as needed.

---

## Setup script (Tip 45)

- **Script**: `shared/prompt/scripts/setup.sh`
- **Use**: Run once from repo root to make context-bar executable and print reminders (cc-safe, handoff path). Add status line to shell profile manually if desired.
