# Project context (AI / tooling)

Single source of truth for project description, structure, conventions, and workflow.  
All tools and models should use this file only; do not duplicate these rules in tool-specific configs.

---

## 1. Project and stack

- **Name**: picker
- **Runtime**: Deno
- **Stack**: Hono (HTTP), Zod (validation), ts-morph (AST), Deno KV (storage)
- **Entry**: `main.ts` (Hono app, KV routes, AST demo)

---

## 2. Directory structure and naming

- **Max depth**: 3 tiers from root (prefix → infix → suffix). Root is not counted.
- **Allowed forms**: `prefix/`, `prefix/infix/`, `prefix/infix/suffix/`
- **Naming axes** (use only approved segment names):
  - **Prefix**: Scope (global, shared, system, module, component) or Layer or Context
  - **Infix**: Actor, Action, or Entity (e.g. prompt, document, service)
  - **Suffix**: Artifact, Policy, or Meta (e.g. store, config, test)
- **This file**: `shared/prompt/store/context.md` (shared = Scope, prompt = Entity, store = Artifact)
- **Exceptions**: .git, .cursor, node_modules, dist, build, coverage, vendor, .cache (confirm per repo)
- Do not add a fourth tier. Do not use forbidden segments (e.g. core in Context; cache as Suffix).

---

## 3. Run, build, test

- **Dev server**: `deno task dev` (runs `deno run --allow-net --unstable-kv --watch main.ts`)
- **Run once**: `deno run --allow-net --unstable-kv main.ts`
- **Test**: Add and run tests via `deno test`; keep commands in `deno.json` tasks if needed.
- **Lint/format**: Use project lint/format config if present; otherwise `deno lint`, `deno fmt`.

---

## 4. Coding and commit conventions

- **Language**: English only for code, comments, docstrings, UI/log strings, and docs.
- **Commit message**: `<type>[(scope)]: <description>`; imperative, lowercase.  
  Types: feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor, perf, test, ci, build. Scope optional (e.g. module or feature flag).
- **Dependencies**: Add only from the project's official list (e.g. deno.json imports); update that list first. No new deps without approval and stable-library criteria.
- **Scope**: Do not add modules, API routes, or infrastructure unless they are in the scope document; update the scope doc first, then implement.
- **Conventions**: Follow existing formatting, naming, and structure; prefer the simplest option (KISS); be consistent.

---

## 5. Frequently used commands

- `deno task dev` — start dev server with watch
- `deno run --allow-net --unstable-kv main.ts` — run server once
- `deno test` — run tests
- `gh pr create --draft` — create draft PR (review before marking ready)
- `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff` — inspect PR for review
- `gh run view` — inspect CI run (e.g. after failure)
- `git worktree add <path> <branch>` — work on another branch in a separate directory
- `realpath <path>` — resolve absolute path when referring to files outside current tree
- **Optional (Phase 10)**: Status line `shared/prompt/scripts/context-bar.sh`; setup `shared/prompt/scripts/setup.sh`; see `shared/prompt/documentation/tips-usage.md` for tips-derived options.

---

## 6. Development workflow

- **Decompose**: Break large work into small steps (A → A1, A2, A3 → B). Tackle one step at a time.
- **Plan then prototype**: Decide high-level approach and structure before coding; use a short plan or prototype to validate approach.
- **Write–test cycle**: Implement, run tests (or manual check), fix failures, repeat. For automation, define how to verify results.
- **Tests and TDD**: Prefer writing tests (failing first), committing the test change, then implementing until they pass. Treat tests and this TDD cycle as the default for non-trivial code.
- **Verify output**: For research or non-code output, ask to verify claims and summarize (e.g. table of what was verified).

---

## 7. Git, PR, CI

- Use **Git** and **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** for commits, branches, pull, and PRs. Any AI that can run the terminal uses the same commands.
- **Draft PRs**: Create with `gh pr create --draft`; review; then mark ready. Prefer draft PRs for agent-generated changes.
- **Parallel work**: Use `git worktree add` when working on multiple branches; one worktree per branch/dir.
- **PR review**: Use `gh pr view` and `gh pr diff`; review file-by-file or step-by-step as needed.
- **CI failure**: Use `gh run view`, logs, and (if needed) `gh` GraphQL/API to find root cause, flakiness, or breaking commit.
- **Dangerous commands**: Audit approved commands periodically (e.g. patterns like `rm -rf`, `sudo`, `chmod 777`, `curl | sh`, `git reset --hard`). Run **cc-safe** (e.g. `npx cc-safe .`) on a schedule (e.g. before opening a PR, monthly). Prefer a script or checklist; do not approve broad destructive permissions.

---

## 8. Integrations and long-running work

- **MCP**: Prefer MCP servers for integrations so any MCP-capable client can reuse them when the model or client changes.
- **Browser automation**: Use Playwright (or similar); document usage here if the project uses it.
- **Paths**: When referring to files outside the current tree, use `realpath` (or equivalent) to pass absolute paths.
- **Long-running jobs**: For CI/build or external waits, use manual exponential backoff (e.g. check at 1m, 2m, 4m, …) instead of one long wait.

---

## 9. Context and handoff

- **New topic**: Start a new conversation when the topic or task changes to keep context focused.
- **Handoff**: For long-running or multi-session work, write a single handoff doc (e.g. `shared/prompt/documentation/handoff.md` or root `HANDOFF.md`) with: goal, progress, what was tried, what failed, next steps. **Workflow**: create or update the handoff file before switching agent or topic; new sessions attach only that file. Optionally use `/handoff` (e.g. dx plugin) if available.
- **Branching experiments**: When trying a different approach from a point in time, fork the conversation or record the branch point in the handoff doc.

---

## 10. Input and output

- **Inaccessible or private content**: If a URL or resource cannot be fetched directly, use "select all → copy → paste" into the chat (or attach the file). For blocked or paywalled sites (e.g. Reddit), use a fallback (e.g. reddit-fetch skill or Gemini CLI); see `shared/prompt/documentation/tips-usage.md` if used.
- **Output format**: Prefer Markdown for reports and docs; use a neutral format (e.g. paste via Notion) when copying to platforms that do not accept Markdown.
- **Getting output out**: Copy from terminal, or write to a file and open in editor; use `/copy` or equivalent if the tool provides it.

---

## 11. Quality and safety

- **Abstraction level**: Choose the right depth: high-level for one-off or low-risk work; file/function/deps-level for critical or complex code.
- **Simplify**: Ask "why this change?" or "simplify unnecessary parts" when the change set is large or unclear. Prefer minimal, clear code and prose.
- **Dangerous commands**: Do not approve broad or destructive commands without explicit need; audit approved commands periodically (see §7).

---

## 12. Maintenance

- **Single source**: Add or change rules and habits only in this file (`shared/prompt/store/context.md`). Do not duplicate in Cursor Rules or other tool configs; reference this file instead.
- **.cursor/rules**: mdc files are for **when** to apply (e.g. always vs on-request); keep one file per apply timing. Rule text stays here only; mdc names follow §D and §E.
- **Review**: Review this file periodically (e.g. quarterly); add repeated instructions as they appear; remove or update outdated lines. Use recent conversations to propose new lines (repeated instructions from chats → candidates for context.md); optionally use a review skill (e.g. review-claudemd) if available.
- **External tips**: Use external guides (e.g. claude-code-tips) as reference only; write only the chosen practices here.

---

## Part B. Rule definitions (authoritative)

Cursor Rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) reference these sections only; they do not duplicate the text below. The role of each mdc is to define **when** to apply (e.g. alwaysApply). Rule content lives only in this file; mdc bodies list which § to follow. Keep the number of mdc files aligned with apply timings (e.g. one always-applied bundle, one on-request).

### §A. Commit message format

Pattern:
  <type>[optional scope]: <description>;
  type and description required; scope optional.
Types:
  feat (new feature), fix (bug fix), docs, chore, refactor, perf, test,
  ci, build; use feat for SemVer MINOR, fix for PATCH;
  use BREAKING CHANGE in footer or type! for MAJOR.
Scope:
  use for feature flag or module (e.g. ff/CHECKOUT_STEP or module name)
  when the commit is scoped to that unit.
Description:
  imperative, lowercase after colon; short summary (e.g. add handler,
  fix validation); optional body after blank line for context.
Footer:
  BREAKING CHANGE: <description> or conventional footers (e.g. Ref: TICKET-1).

### §B. Commit and session boundary

When to commit (mandatory):
  commit at each feature-flag boundary; do not wait until the full task
  is done; one logical unit (one flag or one cohesive change) per commit.
Must commit before next unit:
  before starting the next feature-flag or logical unit, you must run
  git add and git commit for the current changes; do not implement the
  next flag without committing the current one.
Procedure for multi-flag work:
  (1) implement one feature-flag unit only; (2) run git status, git add,
  git commit with message per this rule; (3) only after commit succeeds,
  proceed to the next unit. No batch commit at the end of the task.
Session end:
  no need to output a suggested commit message; commits are made during
  the task at each boundary. Do not run git commit unless the user explicitly asks.

### §C. Language

Language:
  English only for code, comments, docstrings, UI/log strings, docs.

### §D. Document and directory format

Pattern:
  use [prefix]-[suffix].mdc or [prefix]-[infix]-[suffix].mdc;
  prefix and suffix required; infix optional.
Segment form:
  lowercase; separate words with one hyphen; no underscores;
  suffix singular (except types); descriptive, pronounceable, searchable.
Axis rule:
  each segment uses exactly one axis from its allowed set;
  no axis pollution; one word must not appear in two axes.
New rule files:
  pick one prefix from Scope/Layer/Context; one suffix from
  Artifact/Policy/Meta; add infix from Actor/Action/Entity only when
  the rule applies to a specific focus.

Directory structure (max 3 levels; segment order):
  level 1: folder name from approved prefix (required);
  level 2: folder name from approved infix (optional);
  level 3: folder name from approved suffix (optional).
  Order: prefix / infix / suffix; do not add a fourth level.

### §E. Document and directory naming

Clean dictionary (one word per concept — overlap resolution):
  middleware: only Suffix (Artifact); never Infix (use interceptor,
  filter).
  policy: only Suffix (Policy); never Infix (use validator, guard).
  cache: only Infix (Entity); never Suffix (use store, storage).
  config: only this spelling; never configuration.
  education: only this spelling; never edu.
  type (TS/classification): use types in Suffix Meta; never type.
  core: forbidden in Context; use shared, base, or domain (layer).
  context (React/API): use provider in Infix Entity; do not use
  context as segment.

Prefix — one axis only: [ Scope | Layer | Context ].
  Rule: prefix must denote system position only; technical tools
  (cache, redis) or artifact form (config, test) must not be prefix.
  Axis "Context" = Bounded Context (what it is for); Layer value
  "domain" = DDD domain layer only.
Scope (blast radius — where impact reaches):
  global, shared, system, module, component.
  Never prefix: app (use system), config, file, code, architecture.
Layer (stack position — where it sits):
  presentation, application, domain, infrastructure.
  Never prefix: api, web as layer (refine into above if needed);
  security, observability, compliance (use Context instead).
Context (bounded context — what it is for):
  business: payment, order, auth, user, catalog, education, student,
  ticket, bucket, item, economy, scout;
  system: security, observability, compliance.
  Never prefix: core (use shared, base, or domain); cache, adapter,
  redis, test (use Infix/Suffix).

Infix — one axis only: [ Actor | Action | Entity ].
  Rule: infix must not duplicate Scope/Layer/Context meaning.
  Forbidden in Infix: middleware (use interceptor, filter), policy
  (use validator, guard).
Actor (architectural role or agent):
  router, service, repository, entity, interceptor, filter, adapter,
  facade, client, agent, worker, guard, validator.
Entity (data or medium kind):
  payload, stream, blob, cache, session, document, json, sql,
  redis, prompt, provider.
Action (lifecycle or operation):
  bootstrap, shutdown, runtime, build, migration, recovery,
  read, write, batch, parse, upload, search, validate.

Suffix — one axis only: [ Artifact | Policy | Meta ].
  Rule: suffix denotes form of the deliverable; context meaning
  belongs in Prefix, not Suffix.
  Forbidden in Suffix: cache (use store, storage), configuration
  (use config).
Artifact (concrete deliverable shape):
  schema, mapping, store, storage, event, endpoint, response,
  middleware, format, exception, config, pipeline, metrics, trace.
Policy (principle, constraint, or policy):
  boundary, constraint, contract, principle, safety, validation,
  compliance, isolation.
Meta (documentation, test, or classification):
  test, documentation, naming, style, log, types, language,
  profile, assessment.

Examples:
  payment-infra-redis-config (Context + Layer + Entity + Artifact);
  security-application-guard-policy (Context + Layer + Actor + Policy);
  global-config (Scope + Artifact).

### §F. Directory structure and exceptions

Purpose:
  Apply a single rule to all directory creation except exceptions;
  keep structure as prefix → infix → suffix for discoverability and maintenance.

Scope:
  All directories not in the exception list (root and any depth).
  "Level" means directory tiers only: prefix, infix, suffix.
  Root is not counted as a level; max depth is 3 tiers (prefix / infix / suffix).

Rule content — structure:
  Allowed forms (exactly one of three):
    prefix/
    prefix/infix/
    prefix/infix/suffix/
  Order fixed: prefix then infix then suffix; no fourth tier.

Rule content — naming:
  Each tier name must use only approved values for that axis
  (prefix / infix / suffix); see §E. Document and directory naming.
  Lowercase; one hyphen between words; no underscores or spaces.

Exceptions:
  Maintain an explicit exception list; same list for docs and tooling.
  Typical entries: .git, .cursor, node_modules, dist, build, coverage,
  vendor, .cache (confirm per project). Update list and any validator together.

Documentation:
  Rule text lives only in this file; .cursor/rules/*.mdc state scope and when to apply (e.g. always vs on-request). In docs, state: scope, "max 3 tiers" (prefix/infix/suffix only; root not counted), the three allowed forms, order, no fourth tier, naming reference, exception list.

Validation (optional):
  Script: walk directories from root; skip exception list; assert remaining
  paths match prefix/(infix/)(suffix/) and tier names in allowed sets; exit 1 on failure.
  Run in pre-commit or CI.

Agent / tool behavior:
  When creating directories, use only the three allowed forms for non-excepted paths;
  use only approved axis values per §E.

### §G. Dependency constraint

Dependency addition:
  do not add dependencies arbitrarily; only add if (a) listed in the project
  official dependency list, or (b) the addition meets all mandatory
  stable-library criteria below. Agent must not extend the official list
  without human approval.
Official list:
  the project maintains an official list of allowed dependencies (deno.json
  imports and optionally docs); new entries require updating that list first.

### §H. Validation policy (libraries)

Stable library — mandatory (all required):
  (1) release within 12 months on JSR (or registry in use); (2) official docs
  URL; (3) license in allowed set below; (4) no Critical/High CVE at add time,
  and dependency audit in CI when applicable (e.g. deno audit); (5) single
  clear purpose (no kitchen-sink).
Stable library — recommended:
  (6) JSR weekly downloads ≥10k or documented exception; (7) direct deps ≤10 or
  approved exception; (8) SemVer or explicit version policy; (9) no
  Critical/security issues open >90 days; (10) alternative libs exist and
  migration path documented. Prefer all; document exceptions.
Allowed licenses (project):
  permissive: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, ISC;
  copyleft compatible: GPL-3.0-or-later, AGPL-3.0-or-later,
  LGPL-2.1-only, LGPL-3.0-or-later; also MPL-2.0. Not allowed:
  GPL-2.0-only unless explicitly approved, proprietary, or incompatible
  copyleft terms.

### §I. Agent principles

Conventions:
  follow standard conventions (formatting, naming, structure).
KISS:
  prefer the simplest option; reduce complexity.
Boy scout rule:
  leave anything you touch cleaner than you found it.
Root cause:
  find it; address causes, not only symptoms.
Consistency:
  be consistent across the project (terms, tone, layout).
Phrasing:
  prefer positive phrasing in docs and specs
  ("Do X" over "Do not do Y").
Rule file format:
  one rule per block; no blank line between rules;
  wrap with indent so continuation is clearly the same rule.
Rule file line wrap:
  break only at punctuation (;, ,) or after a complete phrase;
  never split a noun phrase or parenthetical mid-phrase;
  meaning per line over 80 chars in rule files.
Clear rules (when adding from docs):
  only add to rules what satisfies all three: (1) stateable as
  must/do not/only in one sentence, no prefer/recommended;
  (2) concrete scope (files, symbols, or patterns named);
  (3) violation detectable by static check or simple heuristic;
  otherwise keep in docs or as guidance only.
No speculative implementation:
  do not add modules, endpoints, or infrastructure for a future
  phase or roadmap; add only when the feature is in current scope
  (docs/scope.md).

### §J. Migration boundary

When to migrate (diagnosis):
  rule files that mix axes (e.g. two suffixes in one name or one file)
  or use forbidden prefix/segment must be refactored; plan first, then
  execute; do not rename or split without a migration plan.
Plan before execute:
  write a migration plan: for each current file, list target filename(s)
  with axis (prefix, infix, suffix), content responsibility per new
  file, and which current files will be removed; do not execute
  renames or splits without this mapping.
Execute order:
  create all new rule files with split content first; only after that
  delete the old files; one logical migration (one plan) per commit.
Naming:
  new rule file names must follow §D and §E; use infix from Actor/Action/Entity where it
  clarifies focus (e.g. document, event, agent).
No scope doc change:
  adding or refactoring .cursor/rules does not require docs/scope.md
  change; scope doc is for modules, API routes, infrastructure only.

### §K. Scope document boundary

Scope document:
  the single source of truth for in-scope modules, API surface, and
  infrastructure is docs/scope.md; update that doc before adding.
Scope-bound implementation:
  do not add new modules, API routes (routers), or infrastructure
  (broker, extra DB, queue, search engine) unless they are listed in
  docs/scope.md; add them to docs/scope.md first, then implement.

### §L. Agent and scope

Agent and scope:
  agent must not extend scope arbitrarily; propose scope doc changes
  for human approval, then implement only after scope is updated.
